    <h1>The Myth, The Legend, The Worlds Greatest Chocolate Chip Cookie</h1>
    <p>Have you ever bit into a chocolate chip cookie, and thought to yourself, 
        "This just isn't it."? Fear no more, because I am here to take that thought,
    and make it so nonexistent, that you will in fact never come across it again.
    By following these simple steps below, you will create a cookie so desirable, so mouthwatering.
    that it really should be illegal it even exists. I've known people who, maybe not proud of it, but
    have stated they would indeed sell their children for such cookie.</p>
